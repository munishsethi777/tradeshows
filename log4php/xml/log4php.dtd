<!-- A configuration element consists of optional renderer
elements,appender elements, categories and an optional root
element. -->
<!-- [log4php] -->
<!--
    category instead of logger cannot be used. categoryFactory is not implemented in log4php.

<!-- [/log4php] -->
<!-- The "threshold" attribute takes a level value such that all -->
<!-- logging statements with a level equal or below this value are -->
<!-- disabled. -->
<!-- Setting the "debug" enable the printing of internal log4j logging   -->
<!-- statements.                                                         -->
<!-- By default, debug attribute is "null", meaning that we not do touch -->
<!-- internal log4j logging settings. The "null" value for the threshold -->
<!-- attribute can be misleading. The threshold field of a repository    -->
<!-- cannot be set to null. The "null" value for the threshold attribute -->
<!-- simply means don't touch the threshold field, the threshold field   -->
<!-- keeps its old value.                                                -->
<!-- renderer elements allow the user to customize the conversion of  -->
<!-- message objects to String.                                       -->
<!-- Appenders must have a name and a class. -->
<!-- Appenders may contain an error handler, a layout, optional parameters -->
<!-- and filters. They may also reference (or include) other appenders. -->
<!-- [log4php] -->
<!-- error handler tag has no effects since log4php does not handle errors. Defintion deleted. -->
<!-- [/log4php] -->
<!-- If no level element is specified, then the configurator MUST not -->
<!-- touch the level of the named logger. -->
<!-- If no priority element is specified, then the configurator MUST not -->
<!-- touch the priority of root. -->
<!-- The root category always exists and cannot be subclassed. -->

<!-- The timestamp format is application dependent. -->
